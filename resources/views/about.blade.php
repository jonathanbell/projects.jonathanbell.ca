  <h2>Hi, I'm Jonathan</h2>

  <p>I'm a front-end web developer who switched to decaf coffee in 2013 and formerly a UX Technical Analyst for the British Columbia Public Service in Victoria, BC. I do freelance development and design for projects that I find interesting, challenging or exciting.</p>

  <p>I also enjoy <a href="https://30.jonathanbell.ca/climbing/">rock climbing</a>, trail running and <a href="http://jonathanbell.ca/">photography</a>. I'm inspired by a hot cup of decaf, hip-hop, and snowy mountains.</p>

  <p>Please feel free to <a href="mailto:jonathanbell.ca@gmail.com">contact me</a> if you would like to work on a project together.</p>
